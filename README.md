# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Project-5â€“Graph-Based-Social-Network-Simulation

This project was developed as the final assignment for the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course at Guilan University of Technology, under the supervision of Dr. Mir Roshandel (Term 1402-1).
The project simulates real-world interactions and relationships using various graph types and explores the application of graph traversal, suggestion systems, and shortest path algorithms.

## ðŸ§© Key Features

* **Friendships**: Modeled using a **directed unweighted graph**. Users can `follow` or `unfollow` each other. Posts from a user appear on the feed of their followers.
* **Suggestions**: Suggested friends are managed with a **directed weighted graph**, where edge weights represent priority based on mutual connections. A recommendation algorithm ranks these suggestions.
* **Cities**: A **predefined undirected weighted graph** models distances between cities. These distances are used in potential route-related features (e.g., shortest path computations).
 Search**
* Some additional features were also implemented
